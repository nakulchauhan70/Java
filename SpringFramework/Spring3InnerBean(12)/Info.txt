Load multiple Spring bean configuration files in the code :

ApplicationContext context = 
    	new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(new String[] {"Spring-Common.xml",
              "Spring-Connection.xml","Spring-ModuleA.xml"});
             
             
<==================================================================>

In a large project structure, the Spring’s bean configuration files are located in different
folders for easy maintainability and modular.
For example, Spring-Common.xml in common folder, Spring-Connection.xml in connection folder,
Spring-ModuleA.xml in ModuleA folder…and etc.
