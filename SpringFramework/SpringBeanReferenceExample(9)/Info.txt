Actually, the ‘ref’ tag can access to a bean either in same or different XML files,
however, for the project readability, you should use the ‘local’ attribute if you reference to a bean which declared in the same XML file.

IMPORTANT
<import resource="classpath:Spring-Output.xml"/> Include this 
OR
<import resource="Spring-Output.xml"/>
into Spring-Common.xml

<==================NET HELP==================================>
Spring-Security.xml file resides in classpath (src/main/resources folder), 
so in your ApplicationContext.xml, 
you need to change from 
<import resource="classpath:/resources/config/spring/beans/Spring-Security.xml"/> to <import resource="classpath:Spring-Security.xml"/>
